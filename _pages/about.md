We aim to uncover fundamental molecular mechanisms of physics in materials. The lab studies how the thermal transportation behavior happens in microstructures and the role that phonon plays in the mechanism. Our research team values a wide diversity of views and racial/cultural backgrounds that brings new thinking into how nature works. We aim to foster an inclusive environment that maximizes student development and team building.
